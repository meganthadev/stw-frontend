I know - shocker, right?!</h4><h5> We are all so different, we all have different skin types and life styles, and there are so many different skin care brands and lines and products and ingredients - and not to mention they all require your hard earned money! People all over the world have different concerns and conditions and sometimes it can feel like the skin care companies do not care - Enter Skin That Wins! An honest platform to share your skin care "Gos and Woes" (aka what works for you and what does not)! A wealth of information shared by a community of skincare (and haircare) afficionados, who are not looking to sell you products, but are just looking to share, and maybe gain, some new light and knowledge in the sea of skincare!</h5><br></br><br></br>
